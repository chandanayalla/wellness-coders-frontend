            <Text>
              Carbohydrates are the primary source of energy for athletes. Planning meals that include complex carbohydrates like whole grains, fruits, and vegetables can provide athletes with sustained energy levels during training or competition. This helps to prevent fatigue and allows athletes to perform at their best.
            </Text>
            <Text>
              Proteins are essential for muscle repair and growth. Meal planning allows athletes to incorporate sufficient protein sources such as lean meats, poultry, fish, eggs, and plant-based proteins into their diet. By consuming adequate protein, athletes can enhance their muscle recovery and support the development of lean muscle mass, which can contribute to improved performance.
            </Text>
            <Text>
              Fat is another important nutrient for athletes as it provides essential fatty acids and aids in the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins. Meal planning allows athletes to include healthy fats like avocados, nuts, and seeds in their diet. These fats can provide a sustained source of energy and support overall health and performance.

            The goal of sports nutrition is to ensure you’re well-hydrated, well-fueled, and well-nourished.
            If you just take care of those three factors, you give yourself a serious edge. That’s because you’ll improve
            your ability to gain strength, muscle, and endurance, recover faster between workouts and competitions, heal more
            quickly from injuries, and perform your best when it matters most.

            Research shows that athletes rarely meet all of their nutritional needs. Even those who try to eat a healthy diet may not get enough fluids,
            calories, macronutrients, or micronutrients. This is true for everyone from youth athletes to professional athletes. 
            Nutrient deficiencies can reduce endurance, decrease muscle strength and power, increase recovery time, reduce muscle mass, and increase body fat.
            For adolescent athletes, being consistently well-fueled throughout the day is critical—not just for performance but for overall health and well-being, too.
            Chronic energy deficits can cause delayed puberty, short stature, menstrual dysfunction, loss of muscle mass, fatigue, and an increased chance of injury or illness.
            The easiest way to calculate your personal calorie needs is to use our nutrition calculator. Just answer each question, and in less than a minute, you’ll have
            a sports nutrition plan that’s 100 percent customized for your goals, including the amount of calories, protein, carbs, and fat you should eat.

          Meal planning is the process of building a weekly menu to best suit your nutritional needs. “It can take the guesswork out of dinnertime, help you to stick to a budget, and help keep your nutrition goals on track,” says Stacey Simon, MS, RDN, who offers counseling through her New York City practice.

Some people follow a meal plan with a specific outcome in mind, such as weight loss or cholesterol improvements. Or an athlete may plan their meals to ensure that they get enough of the nutrients they need to perform. Others meal plan to stick to a food budget or map out meals for an entire family, says Alix Turoff, RD, the New York City–based host of the “Alix Turoff Nutrition Podcast.”

There are different types of meal plans. Some may be geared toward managing a specific health condition, such as type 2 diabetes or heart disease. These meal plans are often created with input from a registered dietitian or healthcare provider. For example, people with type 2 diabetes typically follow a diabetes-friendly meal plan to control their blood sugar levels, while people concerned about a family history of heart disease may follow a meal plan focused on heart health.

People who aren’t trying to manage a health condition will typically make their own meal plans by selecting healthy recipes that their families enjoy.

          <Text fontSize="md" mb={6}>
          
There are many reasons to plan your meals in advance. “No matter the goal, everyone can benefit from meal planning because
 it’s a really good way to get organized and have some sort of road map for the week,” Turoff says.

Meal planning takes a little effort at the outset to think through what you’re going to eat the following week, 
but having a plan in place takes away the stress of planning and cooking meals every day. So meal planning may be 
especially helpful for people who work long hours, manage a health condition like diabetes, or have a family to feed.
 You don’t even have to stick to your meal plan down to every last detail — simply having a rough guide can be enough to 
 take some of the stress out of grocery shopping and preparing meals every week.

Meal planning can also help you follow a healthy eating pattern. “If you don’t have a plan in place, you may be more
 inclined to order a pizza on a busy evening, even if it’s not something you’re going to truly enjoy,” Simon says. 
 
          </Text>
          <Image

            boxShadow="lg"
          />
          <text fontSize="md" mb={6}>
          But if you know you have a healthy and delicious meal waiting for you at home, that pizza or trip to the drive-thru may
  sound less appealing.Eating healthier is beneficial for everyone, but it’s especially helpful for people who need to pay 
  close attention to the foods they eat, like those with type 2 diabetes or heart disease. Having a meal plan can make healthy
   eating less overwhelming for these people. “You’re not stressing about what foods go with what, and you know ahead of time that
    these foods have been cleared by your doctor or dietitian to help manage your condition,” Turoff says.

You may even save money by meal planning, not only by eating fewer meals out but by cutting down on food waste.
 The average family of four spends $1,500 a year on food that goes uneaten, and food accounts for the largest proportion
  of refuse in landfills, with more than 20 tons of food waste in a given year.
“When you go to the grocery store without a plan, you just kind of buy whatever sounds good at the moment, but you have no 
idea what to do with it,” Turoff says. Inevitably, that food will sit in your fridge or cupboard until you finally throw it out.
 But when you plan out your meals, you know what and how much food to buy, which leads to less food (and money) wasted.
